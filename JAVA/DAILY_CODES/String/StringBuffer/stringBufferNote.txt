String is immutable in Java that means if we make changes in string then it will creates new object instead of doing some change in same string
immutable means not changable
StringBuffer is mutable...we can do some changes in string with same string without creating new object
StringBuffer creates objects on Heap area
String can be on SCP or on Heap
Capacity o StringBuffer is 16 characters
if we know that we are not going to make any changes in string then string class is best
else use StringBuffer
